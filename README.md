# Probabilistic-Deep-Learning


In this Capstone Project for the course "Probabilistic Deep Learning with Tensorflow 2", I had the chance 
to practice the Tensorflow Probability library, built on Tensorflow itself, that allows us to combine
probabilistic to deep learning models. I could use normalizing flow networks and variational autoencoder
algorithms. I created a synthetic dataset with a normalising flow with randomised parameters. This dataset 
is then used to train a variational autoencoder, and we will use the trained model to interpolate between 
the generated images. There were many recently studied concept, including Distribution objects, probabilistic
layers, bijectors, ELBO optimisation and KL divergence regularisers.
It was challenging and amazing.
I am looking forward to practicing more and with more generative models.
